## Data-analysis---Energy-consumption

### Project Title: Energy Consumption Analysis

### Technologies:
* Data Cleansing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Visualization (Power BI)

### Domain: 
Energy and Sustainability

### Problem Statement:

Project will analyze energy usage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of Ontario's Broader Public Sector (BPS) organizations, leveraging a comprehensive database of reported data. We aim to identify trends, assess conservation effectiveness, and pinpoint areas for improvement, informing data-driven strategies to achieve climate change mitigation goals within the BPS.

### Data Understanding

The Dataset spans from 2012 to 2021 and contains information about BPS organizations, including public hospitals and school boards.Key attributes include organization details, operational information, energy consumption data, and GHG emissions.

### Key Features:

Sector: Represents the sector of the organization (e.g., Public Hospital, School Board).

SubSector: Provides further classification within the sector.

Organization: Name of the BPS organization.

Operation: Specific operation or facility within the organization.

Address, City, Postal Code: Location details of the organization.

Energy Usage: Information about electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, propane, coal, wood, district heating, and district cooling consumption.

GHG Emissions: Greenhouse gas emissions in kilograms.

### Data Preparation and Cleansing:

Data was Cleaned and transformed into a format suitable for analysis by handling missing values, standardizing units, and deriving relevant features.

Segmented the data by relevant factors like sector, organization type, and facility size.

### Exploratory Data Analysis-PowerBI

Employed statistical analysis and visualization techniques to uncover key trends, patterns, and relationships within the data.
Investigate correlations between energy consumption, GHG emissions, and relevant features like building size, operational hours, and weather data.

Identified outliers and potential areas for further investigation.

Developed compelling and interactive visualizations using Power-BI to effectively communicate key insights from the EDA.

Createed dashboards showcasing energy consumption and GHG emissions by sector, organization, and facility type.

Designed comparative visualizations to analyze performance trends and benchmark organizations against established metrics.
